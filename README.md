# MicroCT-Image-Analysis-with-ImageJ-Fiji
Micro X-ray Computed Tomography (microCT) image analysis provides information about micro-scale structures and properties critical to the biological and geoscientific fields. Recent advances in microCT have in part been driven by the availability of new 3D image processing techniques. These techniques, while developed for the biological/life sciences, have the potential to support other scientific fields given an appropriate application. For example, microCT analysis can provide information about the density and structure of the microfossil shells of foraminifera, which are commonly used in paleoceanography to reconstruct aspects of the ocean and climate. Information about the density and structure of foraminiferal shells is useful for characterizing changes in ocean acidification and in foraminiferal species classification and assemblage-based sea surface temperature studies. The macros presented here provide a user-friendly semi-automated workflow for applying imageJ/Fiji tools to extract microCT-derived information on many individuals scanned together in a batch. The example datasets provided are of a batch of individual foraminiferal shells. The batch is small (six individuals) for simplicity of the example, but the workflow is applicable for rapidly processing large batches (dozens to hundreds) of individuals.
